## Visualizing Tufts Graduate Outcomes    
   




Greetings hackers! In this technical demo, we're going to show you how to create a map visualization - from web mining to data processing to visualization - using a bunch of different tools.

If you're somewhere in the **beginner** to **intermediate** skill level for Python, and Javascript (ideally both, but one or the other is fine too), then you'll probably get the most of this demo. If not, our code / this document is still worth a skim!

Here are some technical concepts that we touch on in this demo:
1. creating a simple web scraping script (Python)
2. basic data parsing / processing (Python)
3. creating an interactive data visualization (Javascript) 

## Overview


## Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup


## Data Cleaning / Processing with Pandas


## Visualizing with d3.js
